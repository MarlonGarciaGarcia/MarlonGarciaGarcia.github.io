  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>For this project I focus myself in getting trying to add objects into the skull, Ive always been a fan of skull and roses tattoos, I wanted to recreate something I would like tattoo myself in the near future. I also tried to create something
    abstract because sometimes it just works out randomly without expecting it. I used a skull and put two roses one in each eye. I also added a horn to the skull because it just looked cool and using meshmixer I used one of the layers that it
    provides to set it kind of as a stand. Putting this project took quite the energy because I wanted something people would feel triggered to look and wanting to interract. Overall I am happy with my final piece.</p>

  <p>Using three objects/forms that are from both existing and found (downloaded from the internet) sources, mix together a virtual 3D sculpture using Meshmixer. Design the impossible! Your mashup may be an exciting re-interpretation of a classic
    form or even a chaotic mess made of organic and/or geometric designs. You are also required to visualize the purpose and "story" behind the objects that you choose to model.</p>
